# Project 4 Proposal: collabr

## MVP
This product ideally allows multiple users to collaborate on a playlist/playlists in realtime by searching for songs. Any of the collaborators can stream the playlist from their devices.


## User Stories
When the user is logged in they can 
- view their past playlists,
- start a new playlist and invite others to join by sending link or some kind of invitation, or
- collaborate on a friend's playlist.
When the user is not logged in, they can browse and stream music through the API.


## Technologies
- Napster API or some other music API that allows searching for and streaming songs
- Socket IO
- Express.js backend
- React frontend


## Timeline
- Tues 9/12 - Weds 9/13: planning structure of backend/frontent, become familiar with API and Socket IO
- Weds 9/13 - Thurs 9/14: create backend with basic functionality and authentication, start react front-end
- Friday 9/15 - Sunday 9/17 :Integrate music API
- Monday 9/17 - Tuesday 9/19 - debugging, styling, deployment

## Forseen Challenges
I think that using Socket IO will be a challenge because I don't have much experience with it. I also think the searching/streaming music will be difficult.
